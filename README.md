# CreditPath - Smart Loan Predictor

## Overview

**CreditPath - Smart Loan Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan approval based on various applicant features. The application leverages a variety of machine learning algorithms to analyze historical loan data and provide predictive insights for new loan applications.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and transforms input data for model training.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes different algorithms to train models on historical loan data.
- **Prediction:** Provides loan approval predictions based on applicant information.
- **Interactive Form:** User-friendly web interface for inputting applicant data.

## Installation

To run the project, ensure you have Python installed and follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CreditPath.git
   cd CreditPath
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. **Upload Data:**

   Place your dataset CSV files in the `dataset/` folder.

2. **Access the Web Interface:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You will be able to input applicant details and get loan approval predictions.

3. **Model Training and Testing:**

   Open the Jupyter Notebook `Loan_Prediction_Project.ipynb` to see the model training, evaluation, and testing process.
