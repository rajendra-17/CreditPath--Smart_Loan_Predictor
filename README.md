# CreditPath - Smart Loan Predictor

## Overview

**CreditPath - Smart Loan Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan approval based on various applicant features. The application leverages a variety of machine learning algorithms to analyze historical loan data and provide predictive insights for new loan applications.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and transforms input data for model training.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes different algorithms to train models on historical loan data.
- **Prediction:** Provides loan approval predictions based on applicant information.
- **Interactive Form:** User-friendly web interface for inputting applicant data.
